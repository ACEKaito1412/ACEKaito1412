# Projects Need to be Finish
- `Camera App Using Web` : this is my first test project when i'm dealing with Hand Sign using Mediapipe, but found out that device cant handle the data, and tends to be slow. I'm changing this one to camera app.

    - Create the backend server using flask
    - Show data using this repo.
